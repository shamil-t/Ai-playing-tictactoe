EasyAI is an artificial intelligence framework for two-players abstract games such as Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Reversi, etc.

It is written in Python and makes it easy to define the mechanisms of a game and play against the computer or solve the game (see A quick example).

Under the hood, the AI is a Negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables as described on Wikipedia. It has been written with clarity/simplicity in mind, rather than speed, so it can be slow, but there are fixes (see How To Make The AI Faster).
